## About Project

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- git clone <repository_url> and switch master branch
- after completion of clone run: composer install
- make a copy of the .env.example file and rename it to .env and database configurations
- php artisan key:generate
- php artisan migrate
- php artisan serve
